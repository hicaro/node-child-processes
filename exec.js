    By default, the exec function creates a shell to execute the command we pass into it.
    It buffers the commandâ€™s generated output and passes the whole output value to a callback function.

    Important: Note that using the shell syntax comes at a security risk.
    If executing any kind of dynamic input provided externally, 
    a user can simply do a command injection attack using shell syntax characters like ; and $ 
    (for example, command + '; rm -rf ~')


    Note: If you need to execute a file without using a shell, 
    the execFile function is what you need. It behaves exactly like the exec function, 
    but does not use a shell, which makes it a bit more efficient.

var exec = require('child_process').exec;

/*
    Since the exec function uses a shell to execute the command, 
    we can use the shell syntax directly here making use of the shell pipe feature.

    console.log(`Number of files ${stdout}`);
