## Node.js Child Processes

This code was an excerpt from Samer Buna's [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/node-js-child-processes-everything-you-need-to-know-e69498fe970a) hosted on Medium.

The post talks about the different techniches to create child processes in Node.js and their cons ans pros.

We can easily spin a child process using Nodeâ€™s `child_process` module and those child processes can easily communicate with each other with a messaging system.

There are four different ways to create a child process in Node: `spawn()`, `fork()`, `exec()`, and `execFile()`.

Events that we can register handlers for with the child_process instances are:
    * `disconnect`;
    * `exit`;
    * `error`;
    * `close`;
    * and `message`.


### The *Sync function
The functions `spawn`, `exec`, and `execFile` from the `child_process` module also have synchronous blocking versions that will wait until the child process exits. The synchronous version of them are: `spawnSync`, `execSync`, and `execFileSync`.
